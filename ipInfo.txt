These are the ISS Disabled subnets. You may be able to scan the eduroam ISS Disabled subnet from Wired Lawn ISS Enabled, but for the rest you will need to be on that subnet in order to scan. It may actually be tricky to get a host onto ResNet ISS Disabled without being in a Residence Hall, but we can work that out.
